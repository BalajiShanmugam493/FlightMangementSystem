# FlightMangementSystem

It is done using Struts2.The main objective is to learn about the back end.The front end is just a blunt page so it will be not
impressive.The back end is done with struts2 with java database connectivity.The database is mysql.The main functions are
         1 . create flights
         2 . read flights
         3 . update flight deatils
         4 . delete flights
         5 . search flights
The major approach used is brute and force approach. But to find the cost by searching the shortest path, the graph's shortest 
path algorithm(Dijkstra's algorithm) have been used.
